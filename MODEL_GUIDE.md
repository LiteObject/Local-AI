# Best AI Models 2025: Which Local AI Model Should You Use?

**TL;DR:** Just download llama3.2:3b and start there. It's like the iPhone of AI models - works great for most people.

Complete guide to choosing the best AI models for local installation. Compare Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, Phi 3.5, and other top AI models for coding, writing, and general use.

## Best AI Models for Beginners (2025 Recommendations)

### Your first download
**llama3.2:3b** - This is what I recommend to everyone
- Handles conversations, writing, and basic coding pretty well
- Small enough to run on most computers
- Fast enough that you won't get impatient

### Other solid options
**phi3.5:3.8b** - Microsoft's entry
- Really efficient for what it does
- Good for learning without burning through your RAM

**qwen2.5:7b** - The multilingual one
- Great if you need languages other than English
- Solid reasoning abilities

**gemma2:9b** - Google's offering
- Reliable and well-tested
- Good all-around performance

## Best AI Models by Use Case: Coding, Writing, and General Tasks

### Just chatting and writing stuff
- **llama3.2:3b** - My go-to for daily use
- **qwen2.5:7b** - If you need multiple languages
- **mistral-nemo:12b** - When you want higher quality (needs more power)
- **gemma2:9b** - Reliable alternative

### Getting help with code
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - This one's really good at coding
- **starcoder2:7b** - Updated coding model with better performance
- **granite3-dense:8b** - IBM's latest, much improved for technical tasks
- **deepseek-coder-v2:16b** - Even better if your machine can handle it
- **codegemma:7b** - Google's coding specialist

### Creative writing and storytelling
- **llama3.2:3b** - Good storyteller and fast
- **mistral-nemo:12b** - Really excels at creative stuff
- **qwen2.5:14b** - Strong creative writing
- **qwen2.5:32b** - Top tier but needs a beast of a machine

## The newer stuff (August 2025 updates)

### Latest and actually worth trying
- **llama3.3:70b** - Meta's newest big model (you'll need serious hardware - 40GB+ RAM)
- **deepseek-r1:7b** - New reasoning model that's genuinely impressive at complex problems
- **granite3-dense:8b** - IBM's latest, much improved from the original granite-code
- **smollm2:1.7b** - Microsoft's new lightweight model that punches above its weight
- **qwen2.5:32b** - Alibaba's larger brain for complex thinking
- **starcoder2:7b** - Updated coding model with better performance

### Specialized options that actually work
- **deepseek-r1** series - Excellent for reasoning through complex problems
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - Still the best general coding assistant
- **granite3-dense:8b** - Great for technical tasks and coding
- **gemma2:27b** - Google's larger model for when you need more capability
- **bge-large** - If you need embeddings and search (probably not relevant for most people)

*Fair warning: The 30B+ models need serious hardware. Most people are better off with 7B-14B models that actually run well on their machines.*

## Model sizes - what they actually mean

Think of model size like engine displacement in cars - bigger usually means more powerful, but also uses more resources:

- **3B models** - Like a fuel-efficient compact car. Quick responses, handles basic tasks
- **7B models** - Like a mid-size sedan. Good balance of power and efficiency  
- **13B models** - Like a performance car. More capable but needs premium fuel (RAM)
- **30B+ models** - Like a supercar. Incredibly capable but most people can't afford to run them

## How to actually choose

1. **üéØ Just start with llama3.2:3b** - seriously, stop overthinking it
2. **üåç Need other languages?** Grab qwen2.5:7b  
3. **üíª Want coding help?** Try qwen2.5-coder:7b
4. **üöÄ Got a powerful machine and want quality?** Go for mistral-nemo:12b

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Don't download a 70B model if you only have 8GB RAM - it won't work!

## Decoding those weird model names

These names look like gibberish but there's a pattern:
- **llama3.2** = Model family and version
- **8b** = Size (8 billion parameters - bigger number = smarter but slower)
- **q4_k_m** = How much it's compressed (smaller file, tiny bit less quality)

## Seriously, don't overthink this

- Most people are perfectly happy with **llama3.2:3b**
- You can download different models anytime - it's not a marriage
- Switching between models in LM Studio or Ollama takes like 30 seconds

Start simple, see what you actually need, then upgrade if you want to.
