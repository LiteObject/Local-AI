- **llava:13b** - Vision + language model for image understanding
- **bespoke-minicheck** - Factuality checking model to detect hallucinations

*Fair warning: The 30B+ models need serious hardware. Most people are better off with 3B-14B models that actually run well on their machines.*

## Embedding models (for search and RAG applications)

If you're building search or retrieval applications, these models generate vector embeddings:

- **snowflake-arctic-embed** - High-performance text embedding suite with multilingual support
- **bge-m3** - Multi-functionality, multilinguality, and multi-granularity embedding model
- **all-minilm** - Lightweight sentence embedding models (22M and 33M parameters)

*Most people don't need these unless you're building specific search or RAG applications.*

## Model sizes - what they actually mean

Think of model size like engine displacement in cars - bigger usually means more powerful, but also uses more resources:

- **3B models** - Like a fuel-efficient compact car. Quick responses, handles basic tasks
- **7B models** - Like a mid-size sedan. Good balance of power and efficiency  
- **13B models** - Like a performance car. More capable but needs premium fuel (RAM)
- **30B+ models** - Like a supercar. Incredibly capable but most people can't afford to run them

## How to actually choose

1. **üéØ Just start with llama3.2:3b** - seriously, stop overthinking it
2. **üåç Need other languages?** Try qwen3:4b or glm4:9b (supports 26 languages)
3. **üíª Want coding help?** Try stable-code:3b or qwen3-coder:7b
4. **ÔøΩÔ∏è Want to work with images?** Grab llama3.2-vision:11b
5. **üß† Need complex reasoning?** Try qwq:32b if you have the hardware
6. **ÔøΩüöÄ Got a powerful machine and want quality?** Go for qwen3:14b or olmo2:13b

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Don't download a 70B model if you only have 8GB RAM - it won't work!

## Decoding those weird model names

These names look like gibberish but there's a pattern:
- **llama3.2** = Model family and version
- **8b** = Size (8 billion parameters - bigger number = smarter but slower)
- **q4_k_m** = How much it's compressed (smaller file, tiny bit less quality)

## Seriously, don't overthink this

- Most people are perfectly happy with **llama3.2:3b**
- You can download different models anytime - it's not a marriage
- Switching between models in LM Studio or Ollama takes like 30 seconds

Start simple, see what you actually need, then upgrade if you want to.
