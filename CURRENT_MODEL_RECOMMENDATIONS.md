## üìä What's still worth using vs what's getting old

### ‚úÖ Models that are still current and good
- llama3.2:3b (my daily driver)
- llama3.3:70b (Meta's newest, if you can run it)
- phi3.5:3.8b (reliable and efficient)
- qwen2.5 series (7b, 14b, 32b - all solid)
- gemma2:9b, gemma2:27b (Google's offerings, very capable)
- qwen2.5-coder:7b (still the best general coding model)
- deepseek-coder-v2:16b (if you can run it)
- deepseek-r1:7b (new reasoning model, really impressive)
- mistral-nemo:12b (excellent quality)
- granite3-dense:8b (IBM's improved version)
- smollm2:1.7b (surprisingly good for its size)

### üîÑ Models you should probably replace
- **granite-code:8b** ‚Üí Switch to **granite3-dense:8b** (newer version)
- **codellama:7b** ‚Üí Switch to **qwen2.5-coder:7b** or **starcoder2:7b**
- **llama3.1:8b** ‚Üí Consider **llama3.2:8b** or **llama3.3:70b** for improvements

### üÜï What's new in August 2025?

The AI world moves fast! Here's what just dropped:

- **GPT-OSS** - OpenAI released their first open-weight models with incredible reasoning capabilities, function calling, and configurable thinking effort. Already 84.1K pulls in just 5 hours!
- **Phi-4** - Microsoft's new 14B reasoning model that rivals much larger models in complex reasoning tasks
- **DeepCoder** - A fully open-source 14B coding model performing at the level of o3-mini
- **Mistral Small 3.1** - Adds state-of-the-art vision understanding to Mistral's capabilities
- **T√ºlu 3** - Allen Institute's leading instruction-following model family
- **Qwen 3 family** - Alibaba's massive update with models from 0.6B to 235B parameters, including MoE variants
- **Athene-V2** - 72B parameter model excelling in mathematics and technical tasks
- **Granite 3.2** - IBM's updated models with 128K context and improved reasoning
- **OpenCoder** - Bilingual coding model supporting both English and Chinese
- **Command R7B** - Cohere's model with advanced Arabic language capabilities
- **Dolphin** - Uncensored instruct-tuned models for flexible applications
- **StarCoder2** - Updated transparently trained open code models
- **CodeGemma** - Google's lightweight coding specialist
- **Bespoke-Minicheck** - Factuality checking model to detect hallucinations

## üí° My honest take on what to actually use

I've been testing these models for weeks. Here's what I'm actually running:

**For most people**: Still start with `llama3.2:3b` for reliability, but if you want to try the cutting edge, `gpt-oss` is genuinely impressive for an open model.

**For coding**: `deepcoder:14b` has blown me away - it's performing at o3-mini level for coding tasks. If that's too big, `stable-code:3b` remains excellent.

**For reasoning**: `phi-4:14b` and `gpt-oss` are both genuinely good at thinking through complex problems. The configurable reasoning effort in GPT-OSS is particularly cool.

**For vision tasks**: `mistral-small-3.1` now has vision capabilities alongside its text skills, making it a great all-in-one option.

**For power users**: `athene-v2:72b` is incredible for mathematical and technical work if you have the hardware to run it.

## üéØ Just tell me what to download

**üÜï Want to try AI for the first time?**
‚Üí `ollama run llama3.2:3b`

**üíª Need help with programming?**
‚Üí `ollama run qwen2.5-coder:7b`

**üåç Work in multiple languages?**
‚Üí `ollama run qwen2.5:7b`

**üî• Got a beast machine and want the best?**
‚Üí `ollama run llama3.3:70b` or `ollama run deepseek-r1:32b`

**‚öñÔ∏è Want something balanced and reliable?**
‚Üí `ollama run mistral-nemo:12b`

**ü™∂ Need lightweight but capable?**
‚Üí `ollama run smollm2:1.7b`

**üß† Want the latest reasoning capabilities?**
‚Üí `ollama run deepseek-r1:7b`

## üí° Some practical advice

1. **Don't start with the biggest model** - Begin with 3B-7B, upgrade later if needed
2. **Try the new reasoning models** - deepseek-r1 series is genuinely impressive for complex problems
3. **Watch your resources** - Keep an eye on RAM/VRAM usage, especially at first
4. **Use specialized models** - Coding models really are better at coding, reasoning models excel at complex problems
5. **Check back regularly** - New models drop frequently, and some are genuinely better
