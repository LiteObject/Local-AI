# How to Run LLMs Locally: Best Tools & Optimizations
Running large language models (LLMs) locally requires a combination of hardware, software, and optimization techniques.

## 1. Using Pre-built Tools & UI-Based Runtimes
These tools make it easy to run LLMs without deep technical knowledge:

- **[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)** – A simple desktop app to run local LLMs (supports GGUF models).
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** – Lightweight LLM runner with built-in model downloads (`ollama run mistral`).
- **[GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/)** – A GUI-based tool for running various LLMs locally.

## 2. Using Python-Based Libraries
For more control, you can use Python frameworks:

- **[Text Generation WebUI](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)** – A feature-rich web UI for running LLMs locally.
- **[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)** – A C++-based lightweight framework for running LLaMA models using GGUF quantization.
- **[transformers (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)** – Use with `AutoModelForCausalLM` and `bitsandbytes` for efficient model execution.

## 3. Optimizing for Performance
Since LLMs are memory-intensive, consider these optimizations:

- **Use Quantized Models (GGUF, GPTQ, AWQ, etc.)** – Reduce VRAM usage while maintaining good quality.
- **Use Flash Attention & LoRA Fine-Tuning** – Improves inference speed and reduces memory usage.
- **Enable CUDA Acceleration** – Ensures the RTX 4090 is utilized for faster inference (`--use-cuda` in llama.cpp).

## 4. Running Large Models Efficiently
The type of GPU you need depends on the model size and optimizations:  

- **4GB VRAM** – Small models (e.g., Mistral 7B with heavy quantization like 4-bit GGUF).  
- **8GB VRAM** – Mid-sized models (e.g., LLaMA 2 7B, Mistral 7B with moderate quantization).  
- **12GB VRAM** – Can run 7B models at full precision or 13B models with quantization.  
- **16GB VRAM** – Good for 13B models without quantization or 30B models with offloading.  
- **24GB+ VRAM (e.g., RTX 4090, A6000)** – Can run 30B models comfortably and even 65B models with optimizations.  
- **Multi-GPU setups (e.g., Dual RTX 3090s, A100s, H100s)** – Required for 65B+ models at full precision.  

For those with lower VRAM, techniques like CPU offloading, quantization (GGUF, GPTQ, AWQ), and tensor parallelism can help run larger models.
