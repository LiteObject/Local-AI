# Which AI Model Should You Actually Use?

## If you're just starting out

### Your first download
**llama3.2:3b** - This is what I recommend to everyone
- Handles conversations, writing, and basic coding pretty well
- Small enough to run on most computers
- Fast enough that you won't get impatient

### Other solid options
**phi3.5:3.8b** - Microsoft's entry
- Really efficient for what it does
- Good for learning without burning through your RAM

**qwen2.5:7b** - The multilingual one
- Great if you need languages other than English
- Solid reasoning abilities

**gemma2:9b** - Google's offering
- Reliable and well-tested
- Good all-around performance

## Models by what you actually want to do

### Just chatting and writing stuff
- **llama3.2:3b** - My go-to for daily use
- **qwen2.5:7b** - If you need multiple languages
- **mistral-nemo:12b** - When you want higher quality (needs more power)
- **gemma2:9b** - Reliable alternative

### Getting help with code
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - This one's really good at coding
- **starcoder2:7b** - Updated coding model with better performance
- **granite3-dense:8b** - IBM's latest, much improved for technical tasks
- **deepseek-coder-v2:16b** - Even better if your machine can handle it
- **codegemma:7b** - Google's coding specialist

### Creative writing and storytelling
- **llama3.2:3b** - Good storyteller and fast
- **mistral-nemo:12b** - Really excels at creative stuff
- **qwen2.5:14b** - Strong creative writing
- **qwen2.5:32b** - Top tier but needs a beast of a machine

## The newer stuff (August 2025 updates)

### Latest and actually worth trying
- **llama3.3:70b** - Meta's newest big model (you'll need serious hardware - 40GB+ RAM)
- **deepseek-r1:7b** - New reasoning model that's genuinely impressive at complex problems
- **granite3-dense:8b** - IBM's latest, much improved from the original granite-code
- **smollm2:1.7b** - Microsoft's new lightweight model that punches above its weight
- **qwen2.5:32b** - Alibaba's larger brain for complex thinking
- **starcoder2:7b** - Updated coding model with better performance

### Specialized options that actually work
- **deepseek-r1** series - Excellent for reasoning through complex problems
- **qwen2.5-coder:7b** - Still the best general coding assistant
- **granite3-dense:8b** - Great for technical tasks and coding
- **gemma2:27b** - Google's larger model for when you need more capability
- **bge-large** - If you need embeddings and search (probably not relevant for most people)

*Fair warning: The 30B+ models need serious hardware. Most people are better off with 7B-14B models that actually run well on their machines.*

## Model sizes - what they actually mean

Think of model size like engine displacement in cars - bigger usually means more powerful, but also uses more resources:

- **3B models** - Like a fuel-efficient compact car. Quick responses, handles basic tasks
- **7B models** - Like a mid-size sedan. Good balance of power and efficiency  
- **13B models** - Like a performance car. More capable but needs premium fuel (RAM)
- **30B+ models** - Like a supercar. Incredibly capable but most people can't afford to run them

## How to actually choose

1. **Just start with llama3.2:3b** - seriously, stop overthinking it
2. **Need other languages?** Grab qwen2.5:7b
3. **Want coding help?** Try qwen2.5-coder:7b
4. **Got a powerful machine and want quality?** Go for mistral-nemo:12b

## Decoding those weird model names

These names look like gibberish but there's a pattern:
- **llama3.2** = Model family and version
- **8b** = Size (8 billion parameters - bigger number = smarter but slower)
- **q4_k_m** = How much it's compressed (smaller file, tiny bit less quality)

## Seriously, don't overthink this

- Most people are perfectly happy with **llama3.2:3b**
- You can download different models anytime - it's not a marriage
- Switching between models in LM Studio or Ollama takes like 30 seconds

Start simple, see what you actually need, then upgrade if you want to.
